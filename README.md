# Accessibility Features

## Overview
The Accessibility Features app allows users to customize their experience based on their accessibility needs. It provides options to adjust font size, line height, letter spacing, text colors, background colors, alignment, and more.
**Checkers and tools to ensure your app is accessible to all.**

Creating an accessible app is incredibly important. But too often it's forgotten about, or left to later. This package ensures your app is accessible from day one, by checking your interface as you build it.

## Getting Started

Add `Accessibly` to your app's `Consumer` property:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Consumer<Accessibly>(
      builder: (context, accessibilitySettings, child) {
        return MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          title: 'Accessibility Features',
          themeMode: accessibilitySettings.systemMode
              ? ThemeMode.system
              : (accessibilitySettings.isDark
                  ? ThemeMode.dark
                  : ThemeMode.light),
          darkTheme: accessibilitySettings.darkTheme,
          theme: accessibilitySettings.lightTheme,
          home: const MyWidget(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
}
```
## Current accessibility checkers

To get the Accessibility Controll:

```dart
appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text('Accessibility Features'),
            actions: [
              Builder(
                // Wrap the IconButton with Builder widget
                builder: (context) => IconButton(
                  icon: const Icon(Icons.settings),
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Use the context from the Builder
                    Navigator.push(
                      context,
                      MaterialPageRoute(
                        builder: (context) => const AccessibilityScreen(),
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
```

### widget in Accessiblity-features

Makes sure Text  (`AccessibleHeadingText`, `AccessibleText`,) and Images (`AccessibilityImage`) have semantic labels.

## Configuration

Checkers are enabled or disabled with properties on the `Accessibility` widget:

```dart
 AccessibleHeadingText(
   "Hello This is Accessibility...",
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
),
```
```dart
AccessibleText(
   "This is a simple text widget",
   style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
   ),
```
```dart
AccessibilityImage(
   image: AssetImage('assets/hello.png'),
   width: 200,
   height: 250,
   fit: BoxFit.cover,
   alignment: Alignment.center,
   colorBlendMode: BlendMode.colorBurn,
   filterQuality: FilterQuality.high,
  ),
```
